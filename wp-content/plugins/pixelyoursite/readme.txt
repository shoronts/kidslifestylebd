*URL equals (supports delay)
*Home page

*Post type
*Click on HTML link (pro)
*Click on CSS Selector (pro)
*Mouse over CSS Selector (pro)
*Page scroll (pro)

**PINTEREST TAG: I use WooCommerce or EDD, do I need to add the Pinterest events myself?**

No, absolutely not!
The plugin will fire all the Pinterest e-commerce events automatically.

**Will your plugin increase the loading time of my site?**

The plugin itself is really fast. However, you have to remember that the pixel has to communicate with Facebook, Google, or Pinterest to send all the data, and this will add a little load on your site.

Will this impact on your visitors? No, because all the requests are asynchronous, meaning that the browser will continue to load and your users will not see any delay whatsoever.

**Are there any known incompatibilities with other themes or plugins?**

There are a few you should consider:

*Any plugin or solution that implements the same pixel or tag. Having the same tracking pixel added twice can cause problems.

*We had a problem with Mamaya, a retargeting service.

*It won't work with LeadPages or any similar system because those pages are generated outside WordPress.

*Some clients reported problems with Thrive landing pages. This happens because Thrive removes other plugins JS files.

There's a strange solution: it appears that if you have the Yoast plugin installed the problem will go away.

*Upsell plugins can cause problems with purchase tracking. If they add an intermediary page after the transaction, we have [a filter their developer can use to call our default Purchase event](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/the_mister/zeaXya)

**Are there any situations when the plugin will connect to outside sources?**

Yes, there are, and we will explain them here:

*We offer you the possibility to voluntarily subscribe to our newsletter and get valuable tips.  We manage our newsletter using ActiveCampaing. When you subscribe, we will call our server that intermediates the API connection, and then the data is sent to ActiveCampaign. The information that is passed: the name you provide and the email. If you check the "I use WooCommerce" checkbox, we will add this information as a tag, to give you better tips in the future.

*Add-on updates: the plugin works with free or paid add-ons (for Pinterest, Bing, etc) that we provide and host on our server. When you install such an add-on, we will do checks for updates. If you have a valid license for the add-on, we will automatically download the latest version of the add-on from our servers. The core plugin (PixelYourSite itself) updates are provided using WordPress own servers.

*When you install a pixel or a tag (like the Facebook Pixel or Google Analytics), the script will call for their specific files. These scripts are hosted on their servers (Facebook's servers, Google's servers).

*If you install scripts using our Head & Footer option, these scripts may load files from third-party servers. You can check this using your browser's Console.

**Do you record data about the websites' traffic**

NO, absolutely not! We don't track any type of data about your website. We simply implement the pixel/tag code.

This version still fires the old Signal event by default and you need to manually turn it OFF and enable the automatic events.

function pys_test($event,$pixelId,$eventId) {
error_log(â€œSend event for pixel $pixelId id = $eventIdâ€);
return $event;
}

It is called before the event is sent to the FB server
3 parameters:

â€“ the first one is the event object with all the data

â€“ the second is the pixel id

â€“ and the third is the event id, rendered it separately

You need to take into account that our events are mainly sent via Ajax after the page has loaded.
